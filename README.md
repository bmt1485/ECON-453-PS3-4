# ECON-453-PS3-4
Project for ECON453 - Data Analytics and Modeling: Quantitative Analysis for Economic Strategy

This repository contains my analysis for ECON-453 Problem Set 3+4, focused on cross-sectional regression analysis using real-world data on individual earnings and wages. The project explores model specification, functional form testing, and prediction accuracy through OLS regression, dummy variables, transformations like log-linear models, and F-tests. Additionally, model evaluation is performed using training and validation samples to assess in-sample and out-of-sample performance. All analyses were conducted using R.
